      <p class="aboutParagraph">
        You can usually find me in an antique mall or thrift store searching for 
treasures for my house. I enjoy things that tell a story and have a soul 
to them, with a lot of patina. My style varies from super eclectic 
to modern to rustic. If you stepped inside my home you might think
“oh wow, a super interesting person lives here” or “oh wow, this 
person’s a hoarder of junk”. I’m perfectly fine with either sentiment!
      </p>
      <p class="aboutParagraph">
        I get a lot of my style  and design inspiration from vintage design.  I 
snapped a quick picture of this sticker covered trunk recently. The 
fonts and graphics are stunning. In my spare time I do a lot of volunteer
work in my community. We recently raised $400,000 to go towards the
renovation of a historic building in my town, it will be a community
center.</p>
     
<p class="aboutParagraph">
  I find a lot of joy in creating in all types of mediums. I think it’s my 
constant desire to learn and grow that has brought me to UX Design.
I found myself at a crossroads in my life where I had already
peaked at what I was doing for a living. I’d hit a glass ceiling so to speak. 
I was talking with a co-worker about how I wanted to go back to school for a
formal education in something else. Interior Design to be specific. 
She thought I was nuts to go spend all that time and money. I kind 
of agreed with her. She told me about a friend that was doing really
well in the UX world and thought that might be a good fit for me. 
So I looked into it. And here we are. 
One bootcamp later and I couldn’t be happier.</p>

<p class="aboutParagraph2">
I specialize in creating unique, purposeful designs that stand the test of time. I enjoy finding problems and figuring out the best way to solve them.

My skills include: visual design, information architecture, wireframing, branding, prototyping, storyboarding, card sorting, user research,
graphic design, front end development and a multitude of others.</p>
<p class="aboutParagraph2">
  My experience over the years in multiple mediums I believe gives me an edge in the UX world because I consider every angle of design based 
on who my audience is and the platform. My ideal client would be someone that’s adventurous and forward thinking and appreciates unexpected design.</p>

            You can usually find me in an antique mall or thrift store searching
            for treasures for my house. I enjoy things that tell a story and
            have a soul to them, with a lot of patina. My style varies from
            super eclectic to modern to rustic. If you stepped inside my home
            you might think “oh wow, a super interesting person lives here” or
            “oh wow, this person’s a hoarder of junk”. I’m perfectly fine with
            either sentiment!
          </p>

            I get a lot of my style and design inspiration from vintage design.
            I snapped a quick picture of this sticker covered trunk recently.
            The fonts and graphics are stunning. In my spare time I do a lot of
            volunteer work in my community. We recently raised $400,000 to go
            towards the renovation of a historic building in my town, it will be
            a community center.

            I find a lot of joy in creating in all types of mediums. I think
            it’s my constant desire to learn and grow that has brought me to UX
            Design. I found myself at a crossroads in my life where I had
            already peaked at what I was doing for a living. I’d hit a glass
            ceiling so to speak. I was talking with a co-worker about how I
            wanted to go back to school for a formal education in something
            else. Interior Design to be specific. She thought I was nuts to go
            spend all that time and money. I kind of agreed with her. She told
            me about a friend that was doing really well in the UX world and
            thought that might be a good fit for me. So I looked into it. And
            here we are. One bootcamp later and I couldn’t be happier.

            I specialize in creating unique, purposeful designs that stand the
            test of time. I enjoy finding problems and figuring out the best way
            to solve them.
          </p>
          <p>
            My skills include: visual design, information architecture,
            wireframing, branding, prototyping, storyboarding, card sorting,
            user research, graphic design, front end development and a multitude
            of others.
          </p>
          <p>
            My experience over the years in multiple mediums I believe gives me
            an edge in the UX world because I consider every angle of design
            based on who my audience is and the platform. My ideal client would
            be someone that’s adventurous and forward thinking and appreciates
            unexpected design.
